# Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains four practical assignments from the course **Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures**, completed during the 2023/24 academic year.  
The assignments focus on the implementation and testing of advanced data structures: **Red-Black Tree** and **Fibonacci Heap**, based on pseudocode from the textbook **Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS, MIT Press, 2009)**.
